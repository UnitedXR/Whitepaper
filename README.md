# üåé UnitedXR Intro

{% hint style="success" %}
**UnitedXR helps you make XR superpowered NFTs in three ways**

**Create, Earn, and Buy.**
{% endhint %}

## ‚ú®Create

> Easily create XR projects, no coding experience necessary!

### The people's choice

No need to learn programming to make your own smartphone-ready 3D & AR NFTs.

### 100% free forever

All of our tools are free under the MIT license. Fork our project and do whatever. Go crazy.

### Decentralized

You own your data, not us. Everything is safely stored on IPFS and retrieved via your wallet.

## üí∏ Earn

> Earn UXR and other tokens by selling your creations

### Earn 100% of your sales

Sell your creations on our marketplace and earn 100% of what you make.

### Free-Over-Time

Listing your projects to sell requires a deposit, based on _**twice**_ the estimated costs for hosting. \
We send half your deposit to our Defi partners to earn yield. Over time you get your deposit back.&#x20;

### Customize Your Own Store

Link buyers to your own customizable store page to help sell your brand. \
Choose your royalty rates and how you want buyers to use your products.

## üõí Buy

> Discover and buy NFTs on our marketplace. Get paid back for all purchases over time

### Own what you buy

Everything sold is yours to keep forever. \
Keep in mind that sellers can still limit what you're allowed to do with your purchases.

### Free-Over-Time

Buying products sends your money first to our Defi partners to earn yield. \
After a period of time, it is then sent to the seller. \
This time in Defi provides the capital to eventually get you back the cost of your purchase.

### Buy with confidence

Sellers on our marketplace face severe penalties for bad behavior, including doxing and having their staked tokens slashed.
