## ‚ú®Create

> Upload digital media to sell on our marketplace as products, no experience necessary!

### Showcase your products

Visualize your products in 2D, 3D, or in the real world using augmented reality on your phone.

### Decentralized

You own your data, not us. All files are stored on distributed servers and retrieved via your wallet.

### 100% free forever

Everything we make is free under the MIT license. Copy our code and do whatever. Go crazy

## üí∏ Earn

> Earn money by selling your products.

### Earn 100% of your sales

Sell your products on our marketplace and earn 100% of what you make.

### Free-Over-Time

Yes, you read that right. 100% free... over time. Here's how it works:

* Pay to list your product on our marketplace
* Part of the money is used to actually host your product
* The other part earns money to pay you back in our high-interest accounts

### Customize Your Own Store

Customize your own storefront to sell your brand and make it easy for people to find you.

## üõí Own

> Discover and buy digital products you actually own on our marketplace.

### Own what you buy

Everything bought is yours to keep, trade, or sell to others.

### Free-Over-Time

Buyers get 100% of their purchases back.. over time. Here's how it works:

* Pay to buy a product, and receive it right away
* The money is sent into our high-interest accounts
* Over time, the seller and the buyer get the value of the product sent to them

### Buy with confidence

Good luck trying to scam people on our marketplace! Bad actors face severe penalties:

* Their identity is revealed for the world to see
* They lose the money from all transactions in our high-interest accounts
* Any money they deposited with us in order to sell products is sent to our treasury
