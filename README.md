{% hint style="success" %}
**UnitedXR helps you show digital products in the real world in three ways:**

**Create, Earn, and Own.**
{% endhint %}

## ‚ú®Create

> Easily create products and bring them to life with augmented reality, no experience necessary!

### The people's choice

No need to learn programming to make your products come to life in 3D and augmented reality.

### 100% free forever

Everything we make is free under the MIT license. Copy our code and do whatever. Go crazy.

### Decentralized

You own your data, not us. Everything is safely stored on IPFS and retrieved via your wallet.

## üí∏ Earn

> Earn UXR and other tokens by selling your creations

### Earn 100% of your sales

Sell your creations on our marketplace and earn 100% of what you make.

### Free-Over-Time

Yes, you read that right. 100% free... over time. Here's how it works:

* Pay to list your product on our marketplace
* Part of the money is used to actually host your product
* The other part earns money to pay you back in our high-interest accounts

### Customize Your Own Store

Customize your own product page to sell your brand. \
You can choose from a multitude of options on how your products should be sold and used.

## üõí Own

> Discover and buy products you actually own on our marketplace. Get paid back over time.

### Own what you buy

Everything bought is yours to keep, trade, or sell to others as an NFT.\
Make sure you read how the seller is choosing to let you use the products though!

### Free-Over-Time

Buyers get 100% of their purchases back.. over time. Here's how it works:

* Pay to buy a product, and receive it right away
* The money is sent into our high-interest accounts
* Over time, the seller and the buyer get the value of the product sent to them

### Buy with confidence

Good luck trying to scam people on our marketplace! Bad actors face severe penalties:

* Their identity is revealed for the world to see
* They lose the money from all transactions in our high-interest accounts
* Any money they deposited with us in order to sell products is sent to our treasury
