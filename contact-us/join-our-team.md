{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, work is _**unpaid until we are funded**._ \
__There is no way to know how long this will last, so plan accordingly.

Approved and completed work is tracked and will be paid back at _**twice**_ the value.

However, if we fail to secure funding your work may remain unpaid permanently.

Minor financial investments (<$25k) are also eligible for the same repayment agreement. \
See the [Invest In Us page](invest-in-us.md) for more info.

Thanks to our relationship with the [Orlando Game Space](https://www.orlandogamespace.com), we have access to great front-end development talent. But there are plenty of full-time contributor roles we're missing within UnitedXR we're looking to fill.

For our full-time contributors, there are commonalities we look for.

* Share our belief in the importance of making digital markets free
* Self-starters that like figuring things out
* Great English communication skills (at least through writing, best if spoken as well)

> If any of the roles below sound like you, contact us on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fV2SjJzEUr).

### Lead Web3 Engineer

Our ideal Web3 lead engineer would help us choose our blockchain tech and work with the front-end developers to build out connections between our front end to our Web3 backend.

As a lead, they would also be responsible for communication with the other Web3 engineers and would help translate their needs to the rest of our staff.
