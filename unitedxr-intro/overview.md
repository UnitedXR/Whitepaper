# Overview

Our products make XR content easier and less expensive for everyday people, creators, and developers to create, share, buy, and sell.

UnitedXR provides tools that allow everyone to create XR NFTs and share or sell them.

Current NFT and XR content marketplaces are fragmented within multiple walled gardens using closed source code and take 2%-90% margin cut from sales. This market is ripe for disruption.

Our marketplace uses our innovative <mark style="color:green;">Free-Over-Time</mark> system. This allows us to sell NFTs and XR content with a 0% margin cut taken.

Customers that buy NFTs and XR content benefit as well. Every time you buy something, we use Defi to pay you back. This makes everything you buy Free-Over-Time.

The strategy makes us the #1 place to create, share, buy, and sell as the global standard for XR.

To raise funds, we will sell our token or NFTs as a utility with our marketplace, which will enable reduced Defi lockup periods for sellers and cash-back rewards for buyers.

A portion of our proceeds are donated to other Impact DAOs such as [Klima](https://klima.com), as well as to open source game engines like [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org).
