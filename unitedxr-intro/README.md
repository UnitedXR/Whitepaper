{% hint style="success" %}
**UnitedXR helps you make XR superpowered NFTs in three ways**

**Create, Earn, and Buy.**
{% endhint %}

## âœ¨Create

> Easily create XR projects, no coding experience necessary!

### The people's choice

No need to learn programming to make your own smartphone-ready 3D & AR NFTs.

### 100% free forever

All of our tools are free under the MIT license. Fork our project and do whatever. Go crazy.

### Decentralized

You own your data, not us. Everything is safely stored on IPFS and retrieved via your wallet.

## ðŸ’¸ Earn

> Earn UXR and other tokens by selling your creations

### Earn 100% of your sales

Sell your creations on our marketplace and earn 100% of what you make.

### Free-Over-Time

Listing your projects to sell requires a deposit, based on _**twice**_ the estimated costs for hosting. \
We send half your deposit to our Defi partners to earn yield. Over time you get your deposit back.&#x20;

### Customize Your Own Store

Link buyers to your own customizable store page to help sell your brand. \
Choose your royalty rates and how you want buyers to use your products.

## ðŸ›’ Buy

> Discover and buy NFTs on our marketplace. Get paid back for all purchases over time

### Own what you buy

Everything sold is yours to keep forever. \
Keep in mind that sellers can still limit what you're allowed to do with your purchases.

### Free-Over-Time

Buying products sends your money first to our Defi partners to earn yield. \
After a period of time, it is then sent to the seller. \
This time in Defi provides the capital to eventually get you back the cost of your purchase.

### Buy with confidence

Sellers on our marketplace face severe penalties for bad behavior, including doxing and having their staked tokens slashed.

## Summary

UnitedXR is a DAO that believes that the power to create, share, sell, and own XR content and projects is a human right.

In order to be a public good, we are creating an ecosystem of XR products with the following characteristics.

* **Open-Source MIT License**
  * Completely open to anyone to copy or use in any way
  * We prioritize working with other open-source projects
* **Decentralized**
  * Decentralized solutions to problems are prioritized
  * File storage will use IPFS via the Filebase API
  * Data from the user is owned by the user
  * Our governance and tokens are decentralized by design
* **Free**
  * Our XR creation tools are <mark style="color:green;">free</mark> for anyone to use
  * Our XR NFT marketplace uses <mark style="color:green;">Free-Over-Time</mark> economics, the first to do this
  * Buying and selling costs are paid back to users over time using defi
* **Fairly Launched**
  * We will work with [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co), [Klima](https://klima.com), and other Impact DAOs to raise startup donations
  * We will prioritize paying back any startup costs covered directly by members
  * Selling UXR tokens prelaunch will only be done if absolutely necessary to pay for costs
  * Any pre-launch sold tokens will have clearly defined sell walls and lockup periods
  * Our goal is to have all tokens sold to the community in a fair decentralized way
  * We plan to use [Copper](https://copperlaunch.com) to generate our fair value launched liquidity pools
* **Publicly Owned**
  * Governance & ownership is distributed to all tokens holders
  * UnitedXR is an Impact DAO, a classification of DAOs focused on providing public goods
  * We use [Aragon Govern](https://discord.com/invite/fV2SjJzEUr) for the creation of proposals and our treasury management
  * [Aragon Voice](https://voice.aragon.org/tokens/info/#/0xce0b56632ba8322264806d0c79a2bbfc6f8c6934) is used for signaling support from the community via voting&#x20;
  * Communication between DAO members happens primarily via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fV2SjJzEUr)
  * Quadratic voting and Encrypted (hidden) voting will be used to ensure bad actors and outsized UXR token holders cannot strongarm votes
  * Reputation within the community will be used to provide additional voting power
* **Decentralized Token**
  * We are designing our token to not be a security under the United States Howey test
  * We will pay for a Web3 proficient lawyer to confirm our token is not a security
  * If needed for limited liability protection, we will incorporate in a Web3 friendly country
* **Audited**
  * Our XR Player will appear within high-security Web3 wallets and marketplaces
  * Therefore all our XR Player codes will be audited by the community for security
  * In addition, code and projects sold within our marketplace can be audited as well so that they can also be used in high-security scenarios

## Vision

An unstoppable public ecosystem of products that allows everyone to freely create, share, buy and sell XR content and projects.

## Mission
