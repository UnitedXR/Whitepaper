# What Is XR?

XR stands for extended reality.

To say that content or a project is XR means it is capable of one or more of the following.

* **3D**
  * Appearing within its own discrete space in three dimensions
* **AR - Augmented Reality**
  * Overlayed and augmenting the real world
* **MR - Mixed Reality**
  * Contextually aware and mixed in with the real world
* **VR - Virtual Reality**
  * Allowing the user to inhabit a discrete digital space with multiple senses

An XR project is made up of three parts.

* XR JSON
* XR Content
* XR Context

## What Is XR JSON?

Each XR project is defined using a standardized JSON file. This file describes a project so it can be interpreted by an XR Player.

XR JSON contains information about the following.

* XR Context
  * Is this XR context a requirement or just preferred?
  * Fallback options, what if the XR we want isn't available?
* NFT Information
  * Blockchain
  * ID
* Info
  * Creator
  * Owner
  * Title
  * Description
* Thumbnail
  * Images
  * Videos
* Camera
  * Start position & rotation
  * Field of View and other settings
* Controls
  * The preferred method for users to manipulate the project
* Background
  * What Colors, Gradients, Images, Videos make up the background?
* Content information
  * Location, position, and scale
  * Storage info
  * Appearance info
  * Audit verification link

## What Is XR Content?

XR is made of various types of content including...

* 3D Models
* Videos
* Images
* Audio
* Text
* Effects
* Events
* Code
* User Interfaces

By defining an XR JSON with content, it is possible to create _**anything**_ imaginable.

## XR Context

XR context refers to the way you want to interact with an XR project.

* 3D
* VR
* AR Surface Tracking
* AR Wall Tracking
* AR Image Tracking
* AR Face Tracking
* AR Object Tracking

Any XR project can change between these various XR context types.

Creators can define whether an XR context is a requirement or a preference.

Not every piece of hardware is capable of running each XR context.

* Smartphones
* Tablets
* Personal Computers
* AR Glasses
* Standalone VR
* Desktop VR

If a project requires a certain context the hardware cannot provide, then a fallback option is used.

* Redirect the user to try again on a capable device
* Run the project in a context that is available
