## Why, How, What

In everything we do, we believe we're strongest when <mark style="color:green;">**united**</mark>, we believe in the common good.

The way we are united is by collaborating to propose and create public goods and sharing all the equity and profits fairly.

We are building a publicly owned platform to make it free for everyone to create, earn, and own digital projects that can be shown in the real world.

## Vision

Creating, earning, and ownership are fundamental human rights.

This is true in the real world, and it is true in the digital world.

Someday, the lines between what is digital and what is real will become so blurred as to not matter.

To spread this right to everyone, we need to create a marketplace that is as free as possible.

## Mission

Unite to build a global and free marketplace for products that merges the real and digital worlds.
