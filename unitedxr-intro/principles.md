# Principles

## Why, How, What

In everything we do, we believe we're strongest when <mark style="color:green;">**united**</mark>, we believe in the common good.

The way we are united is by collaborating to propose and create public goods and sharing all the equity and profits fairly.

We are uniting to build a free and publicly-owned platform to create, earn, and buy XR capable NFTs
