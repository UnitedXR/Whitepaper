# Principles

## Why, How, What

### In everything we do, we believe we're strongest when <mark style="color:green;">**united**</mark>, we believe in the common good.

### The way we are united is by collaborating to propose and create public goods and sharing all the equity and profits fairly.

### We are uniting creators to build a publicly owned global ecosystem of products that makes XR creation, sharing, buying, and selling simple, easy, and free for everyone.

## Vision

An unstoppable public ecosystem of products that allows everyone to freely create, earn, and buy XR content and projects.

## Mission

Unite creators to build the global leading XR ecosystem for the public good.
