# ðŸ’š Principles

## Why, How, What

In everything we do, we believe we're strongest when <mark style="color:green;">**united**</mark>, we believe in the common good.

The way we are united is by collaborating to propose and create public goods and sharing all the equity and profits fairly.

Together we are building a publicly owned platform to make it free for everyone to create, earn, and own digital projects.

## Vision

Creating, earning, and ownership are fundamental human rights that everyone should enjoy.

This is true in the real world, and it is true in the digital world.

To spread this right, the world needs a marketplace that is as free as possible for everyone to participate as equals.

## Mission

Unite to build a global and free marketplace for products that merges the real and digital worlds.
