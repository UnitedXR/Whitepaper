# ðŸ’š Principles

## Why, How, What

In everything we do, we believe we're strongest when <mark style="color:green;">**united**</mark>, we believe in the common good.

The way we are united is by collaborating to propose and create public goods and sharing all the equity and profits fairly.

We are building a publicly owned platform to make it free for everyone to create, earn, and own digital projects that can be shown in the real world.

## Vision

We will change the world to expect that buying and selling digital goods should be free and that digital goods can and should appear in the real world.

## Mission

Unite to build the global leading platform for digital projects that can appear in the real world for the public good.
