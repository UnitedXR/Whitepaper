# ðŸ¤” Problems We Solve

### Digital Products

* We make it easy to show digital goods in the real world using augmented reality
* You can showcase multiple products simultaneously and sell collections

### Marketplaces

* Unlike other marketplaces, sellers get 100% of their sales on our marketplace
* No other marketplace makes it easy to view digital goods in the real world
* Buyers in our marketplace actually get paid back for their shopping over time
* Since sellers stake their tokens, we can take them away to de-incentivize bad actors
* We do not require know-your-customer (KYC) checks like centralized markets do

### Mobile Augmented Reality Players

* Almost every player is closed source, we're the first global open-source standard
* Unlike older standards, we're super optimized for augmented reality on smartphones
