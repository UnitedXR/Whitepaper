## Profit Per Sale

The guide below assumes we hold the value of purchases from buyers for 30 days within a USDC decentralized finance pool at 12% APR (1% Monthly) before sending the value to the seller.

From the data below, the median cost for a digital product is $22.50, \
so holding that value in Defi for 30 days gives us an average revenue of $0.225 per sale.\
\
Our [<mark style="color:green;">team</mark>](development-costs.md) has an estimated payment of $100k per year.\
So for every 445k product sold on average, we should be able to pay a team member.

At our optimal team size of 16 team members at a $1.6 million yearly cost, \
we will need to sell more than 7 million digital products on average per year.\
