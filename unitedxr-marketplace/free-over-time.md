# Free-Over-Time

## What Is Free-Over-Time?

An economic system that pays users back for participation via the use of decentralized finance.

For our marketplace, this means both sellers and buyers are paid back for everything they spend.

## How Does It Work?



## Where Did This Concept Come From?

Free-Over-Time is inspired by the regenerative token economics systems discussed in [<mark style="color:green;">greenpill.party</mark>](https://greenpill.party), a book created by the GitCoin DAO.

We've seen the power of free revolutionize many aspects of our lives, and as a public good, we can change what people expect from digital marketplaces. We believe this will help entice new users and builders to join the Web3 movement.

Web3 has already revolutionized finance with decentralized finance (Defi). We believe Free-Over-Time markets are the next logical step in decentralizing digital markets.
