## Vision

An unstoppable public ecosystem that allows everyone to create, share and sell XR content and projects.

## Mission

Unite creators to build the global leading XR ecosystem for the public good.

Our products make XR content easier for everyday people, creators, and developers to create, share, and sell.

All of our products are MIT licensed open source. This includes our XR project player, our XR assets marketplace, and easy XR creation tools.

Current market solutions are fragmented within multiple walled gardens using closed source code. This market is ripe for disruption.

To disrupt the market, UnitedXR is offering most of its services for free. Our XR player is free and open source, working across devices. In our marketplace, we pass all profit margins to the sellers.

The strategy of being open and free makes us the #1 place to buy, create, and sell as the global standard for XR.

Users stake select tokens to use our products, which can be retrieved anytime as UXR tokens plus a portion of our yield profits.

Collaboration is encouraged in our system, as it is more profitable for all involved to hold our token and work together than to directly compete.

A portion of our proceeds are donated to other impact daoâ€™s such as Klima, as well as to open source game engine development.
