# üèß Defi Insurance

Insurance for smart contracts and depegging (when a stablecoin loses it's value vs the asset it should match for 6 weeks or more) is available via decentralized insurance exchanges.

UST (Terra-Luna's algorithmic stablecoin) via the Anchor protocol provides a current average of 20% APR, but this high payout is unsustainable, which means the associated insurance is very high (roughly 1/2 of the payout from the high APR).
