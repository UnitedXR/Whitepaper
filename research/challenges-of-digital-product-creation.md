# ðŸ˜­ Challenges Of Digital Product Creation

## Challenges For Normal People

* Learning to make products yourself is difficult and time-intensive&#x20;
* Paying creators is slow, expensive, and arbitration is hard&#x20;
* Not owning your purchased products limits what you can do with it&#x20;
* Not all product creation ecosystems are available globally
* Product creation ecosystems usually do not support mature subject matter

## Challenges For Product Creators

* Product creation tools can be expensive, reducing profit margins&#x20;
* Asset conversion & optimization is complicated and can be expensive
* Most product creation ecosystems do not work on mobile web and low-end devices
* Current product creation tools do not natively support Web3 wallets and marketplaces

## Challenges For Engineers

* Open source product creation solutions lack financial incentives to work on them&#x20;
* iOS devices are far behind current mobile web standards such as the WebXR API
* Common features are regularly re-coded due to closed source&#x20;
* No guarantee that closed source product standards will be around for the long term&#x20;
* Closed source code makes decentralization hard or impossible

## Challenges For Marketplaces

* Walled gardens maximize profits, so everyone wants their own.&#x20;
* Sellers cannot decide their own rules for how content is used&#x20;
* Not all content sold is optimized to work on low-end devices&#x20;
* Bad sellers are hard and expensive to go after a sale has already occurred
* Fairly sharing profits & equity is difficult in current Web2 solutions
* Adult content isn't always possible to sell in traditional markets
