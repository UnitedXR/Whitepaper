# Market Size \[IN-PROGRESS]

## Total XR Market Size

Based on available data from <mark style="color:green;">imarc</mark> and [<mark style="color:green;">MarketWatch</mark>](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/extended-reality-xr-market-size-2021-covid-19-impact-analysis-by-industry-trends-future-demands-growth-factors-emerging-technologies-prominent-players-future-plans-and-forecast-till-2030-2022-01-07), the total market size of XR is rising from $42 billion in 2021 to $465 billion by 2027 with a compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.20%.

We can draw some conclusions from this data.

* The \~46% annual growth rate includes hardware and software,&#x20;
* The growth of UnitedXR's market may be different since its software only
* It is very likely that the market size UnitedXR serves is growing each year

Of the existing NFT market size, UnitedXR has the potential to become the dominant market leader due to its regenerative token economics and not taking a cut of profits from each sale like existing marketplaces.
