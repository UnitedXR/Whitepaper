We can draw some conclusions from this data.

* The \~46% annual growth rate includes hardware and software,&#x20;
* The growth of UnitedXR's market may be different since its software only

## What Percentage Of The NFT Market Will UnitedXR Serve?

UnitedXR has the potential to become the dominant leader for 80% of the NFT market.

We align closest with the Art, Collectibles, Gaming, and Metaverse categories of NFT sales.

This is due to our unique regenerative token economics approach where we do not take a cut of sales. This should lead to a dominant share of the NFT market.

The remaining Utility category of NFTs can only partially use our ecosystem, as it contains NFTs with no visual representation and an existing purpose such as ENS domain sales.
