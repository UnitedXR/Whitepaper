  Why should existing Web2 XR ecosystems work together to build the open Web3
  UnitedXR ecosystem?

# Why Work Together?

* As an open-source ecosystem, you can fork our code for your needs
* Our code is auditable, so we're compatible with Web3 wallets and markets
* Metaverses can use us to display their XR content on any NFT marketplace
* Open-source code naturally becomes the standard.
* Every feature we make raises the bar for what everyone can do with XR
* Working together on XR lowers the costs for everyone
* Lowering your costs gives you more time to focus on your unique value
* XR popularity will rise faster by developing standard features faster
* Investing in our ecosystem and guiding development earns you yield
* Working together will lead to new opportunities we wouldn't have otherwise
