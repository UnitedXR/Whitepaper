description: Why should existing Web2 XR ecosystems work together to build UnitedXR?

# Why Work Together?

* As an open-source ecosystem, you can fork our code for your needs
* Our code is auditable, so we're compatible with Web3 wallets and markets
* You can use our XR player to display XR content and projects anywhere
* Open-source code naturally becomes the standard
* Every feature we make raises the bar for what everyone can do with XR
* Working together on the same XR ecosystem lowers the costs for everyone
* Lowering your costs gives you more time to focus on your unique value
* XR popularity will rise faster by developing standard features faster
* Working together will lead to new opportunities we wouldn't have otherwise
