# Challenges Of XR

## Challenges For Normal People

* Learning to make XR content yourself is difficult and time-intensive&#x20;
* Paying creators is slow, expensive, and arbitration is hard&#x20;
* Not owning your purchased content limits what you can do with it&#x20;
* XR ecosystems are generally limited to the USA and Europe&#x20;
* XR ecosystems usually do not support mature subject matter

## Challenges For Content Creators

* XR tools for the web are usually expensive, reducing profit margins&#x20;
* Asset conversion & optimization is complicated and can be expensive
* Less expensive XR tools do not generally work on mobile web&#x20;
* Current tools do not support Web3 wallets and marketplaces

## Challenges For Engineers

* Open source XR solutions lack financial incentives to work on them&#x20;
* iOS does not support open source web solutions like WebXR API&#x20;
* Common features are regularly re-coded due to closed source&#x20;
* No guarantee that XR ecosystems will be around for the long term&#x20;
* Closed source code makes decentralization hard or impossible

## Challenges For Marketplaces

* Walled gardens maximize profits, so everyone wants their own.&#x20;
* Sellers cannot decide their own rules for how content is used&#x20;
* Not all content sold is optimized to work on low-end devices&#x20;
