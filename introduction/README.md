# Introduction

## Summary

UnitedXR is a DAO that believes that the power to create, share, sell, and own XR content and projects is a human right.

In order to be a public good, we are creating an ecosystem of XR products with the following characteristics.

* **Open-Source MIT License**
  * Completely open to anyone to copy or use in any way
  * We prioritize working with other open-source projects
* **Decentralized**
  * Decentralized solutions to problems are prioritized.
* **Regenerative Token Economics**
  * All services are effectively free to the user
  * Users must stake tokens to access certain features
  * We use staked tokens to generate yield via decentralized finance (Defi)
  * Stakers can retrieve their tokens along with a portion of the yield from Defi
* **Fairly Launched**
  * A minimal amount of tokens are sold prelaunch to pay for startup costs
  * Any presold tokens have clearly defined sell walls
  * The vast majority of tokens are sold at our public launch
  * Tokens are always sold to the community in a fair way that ensures decentralization
  * We plan to use [Copper](https://copperlaunch.com) to generate our fair value launched liquidity pools
* **Publicly Owned**
  * Governance & ownership is distributed to all tokens holders
  * UnitedXR is an Impact DAO, a classification of DAOs focused on providing public goods
  * We use [Aragon Govern](https://discord.com/invite/fV2SjJzEUr) for the creation of proposals and our treasury management
  * [Aragon Voice](https://voice.aragon.org/tokens/info/#/0xce0b56632ba8322264806d0c79a2bbfc6f8c6934) is used for signaling support from the community via voting&#x20;
  * Communication between DAO members happens primarily via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fV2SjJzEUr)
  * Quadratic voting and Encrypted (hidden) voting will be used to ensure bad actors and outsized UXR token holders cannot strongarm votes
  * Reputation within the community provides additional governance power
* **Audited**
  * UXR token will be audited to ensure it is not a security under USA securities law.
  * Our XR Player will appear within high-security Web3 wallets and marketplaces
  * Therefore all our XR Player code will be audited by the community for security
  * In addition, code and projects sold within our marketplace will be audited&#x20;

## Vision

An unstoppable public ecosystem of products that allows everyone to create, share, buy and sell XR content and projects.
