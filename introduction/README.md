# Introduction

## Summary

UnitedXR is a DAO that believes that the power to create, share, sell, and own XR content and projects is a human right.

In order to be a public good, we are creating an ecosystem of XR products with the following characteristics.

* **Open-Source MIT License**
  * Completely open to anyone to copy or use in any way
  * We prioritize working with other open-source projects
* **Decentralized**
  * Decentralized solutions to problems are prioritized
  * File storage will use IPFS via the Filebase API
  * Data from the user is owned by the user
  * Our governance and tokens are decentralized by design
* **Regenerative Token Economics**
  * All services are effectively <mark style="color:green;">**free**</mark> to the user
  * Marketplace uses Free-Over-Time economics to make the market effectively free for buyers and sellers.
  * Sellers stake tokens based on estimated hosting costs
  * We use staked tokens to generate yield via decentralized finance (Defi)
  * Seller's costs are refunded to them over-time via the Defi yield
  * Buyers purchase goods from sellers, and tokens are sent to Defi for a period of time before being passed to the seller. This yield generation is used to eventually pay back the purchasing price of the good to the customer.
* **Fairly Launched**
  * We will work with [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co), [Klima](https://klima.com), and other Impact DAOs to raise startup donations
  * We will prioritize paying back any startup costs covered directly by members
  * Selling UXR tokens prelaunch will only be done if absolutely necessary to pay for costs
  * All pre-launch sold tokens will have clearly defined sell walls and lockup periods
  * Our goal is to have all tokens sold to the community in a fair decentralized way
  * We plan to use [Copper](https://copperlaunch.com) to generate our fair value launched liquidity pools
* **Publicly Owned**
  * Governance & ownership is distributed to all tokens holders
  * UnitedXR is an Impact DAO, a classification of DAOs focused on providing public goods
  * We use [Aragon Govern](https://discord.com/invite/fV2SjJzEUr) for the creation of proposals and our treasury management
  * [Aragon Voice](https://voice.aragon.org/tokens/info/#/0xce0b56632ba8322264806d0c79a2bbfc6f8c6934) is used for signaling support from the community via voting&#x20;
  * Communication between DAO members happens primarily via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fV2SjJzEUr)
  * Quadratic voting and Encrypted (hidden) voting will be used to ensure bad actors and outsized UXR token holders cannot strongarm votes
  * Reputation within the community will be used to provide additional voting power
* **Decentralized Token**
  * We are designing our token to not be a security under the United States Howey test
  * We will pay for a Web3 proficient lawyer to confirm our token is not a security
  * If needed for limited liability protection, we will incorporate in a Web3 friendly country
* **Audited**
  * Our XR Player will appear within high-security Web3 wallets and marketplaces
  * Therefore all our XR Player codes will be audited by the community for security
  * In addition, code and projects sold within our marketplace can be audited as well so that they can also be used in high-security scenarios

## Vision

An unstoppable public ecosystem of products that allows everyone to freely create, share, buy and sell XR content and projects.
