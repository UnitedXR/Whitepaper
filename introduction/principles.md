# Principles

* UnitedXR is not a company. We do not have a management team or employees.&#x20;
  * We are a collection of builders and stakeholders who hold UXR tokens and are motivated to make the project a success.
* Anyone can create proposals for UnitedXR. UXR token holders will vote on whether to approve or reject these proposals.
* Holding UXR entitles holders to submit and vote on proposals. It does not entitle holders to impose their will upon other contributors.
