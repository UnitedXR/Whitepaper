# What Is XR?

XR stands for extended reality. It refers to an XR project that can be used in the real world and all digital worlds.

An XR project is made up of three things.

* XR JSON
* XR Content
* XR Context

## What Is XR JSON?

Each XR project is defined using a standardized JSON file. This file describes your project so it can be interpreted by an XR Player.

XR JSON contains information about the following.

* XR Context
  * Required or preferred
  * Fallback option
    * Backup contexts to use
    * or user redirection instructions
* NFT Information
  * Blockchain
  * ID
* Description
  * Creator
  * Owner
  * Title
  * Descriptor
* Thumbnail
  * Images
  * Videos
* Camera
  * Start position & rotation
  * other settings
* Controls
  * Starting controls per context
* Background
  * Colors, Gradients, Images, Videos
* Content information
  * Location, position, and scale
  * Storage info
  * Appearance info
  * Audit verification link

## What Is XR Content?

XR is made of various types of content including...

* 3D Models
* Videos
* Images
* Audio
* Text
* Effects
* Events
* Code
* User Interfaces

By combining content, it is possible to create _**anything**_ imaginable.

## XR Context

XR context refers to the way you want to interact with an XR project.

* 3D
* VR
* AR Surface Tracking
* AR Wall Tracking
* AR Image Tracking
* AR Face Tracking
* AR Object Tracking

Any XR project can change between these various XR context types.

Creators can define whether an XR context is a requirement or a preference.

Not every piece of hardware is capable of running each XR context.

* Smartphones
* Tablets
* Personal Computers
* AR Glasses
* Standalone VR
* Desktop VR

If a project requires a certain context the hardware cannot provide, then a fallback option is used.

* Redirect the user to try again on a capable device
* Run the project in a context that is available
