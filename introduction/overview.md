# Overview

Our products make XR content easier for everyday people, creators, and developers to create, share, buy, and sell.

Current market solutions are fragmented within multiple walled gardens using closed source code. This market is ripe for disruption.

To disrupt the market, all of our services are effectively free through the use of regenerative token economics.

All profits for XR sales are passed to the seller. We take 0% of sales.

However, to sell on our ecosystem, you must stake a certain amount of tokens first.&#x20;

These staked tokens can be retrieved at any time, and even earn you a share in the yield we generate by lending them out as liquidity to automatic market makers.

The strategy of being open and free makes us the #1 place to create, share, buy, and sell as the global standard for XR.

Collaboration is encouraged in our system, as it is more profitable for all involved to hold our token and work together than to directly compete.

A portion of our proceeds are donated to other Impact DAOs such as Klima, as well as to open source game engine development.
