# ðŸ†“ Free-Over-Time

## What Is Free-Over-Time?

An economic system that pays users back for participation via the use of decentralized finance.

For our marketplace, this means both sellers and buyers are paid back for everything they spend.

## How Does It Work?

### ðŸ“ˆãƒ»Sellers

* Sellers purchase some of our tokens on the open market for every item they want to list
* The price per item is **twice** the expected amount to host and serve this content
* _**Half**_ of the value is used to actually host and serve the content
* The other _**half**_ is placed into a defi account to earn yield
* Once the defi account has doubled, the original value is returned to the seller
* The rest of the value is pocketed by the UnitedXR DAO

### ðŸ’³ãƒ»Buyers

* Buyers pay for content they want by buying our tokens on the open market or via credit card.
* The seller is informed of the sale
* The value from the sale is locked into a defi account to earn yield
* The defi account earns yield for a set period of time (30, 60, 90, 120 days for example)
* The original value from the sale is removed from defi and sent to the seller
* The remaining value in defi remains until it has earned _**twice**_ the initial value from the sale
* The original value is sent back to the customer, paying back their purchase in full
* The rest of the value is pocketed by the UnitedXR DAO

## Where Did This Concept Come From?

Free-Over-Time is inspired by the regenerative token economics systems discussed in [<mark style="color:green;">greenpill.party</mark>](https://greenpill.party), a book created by the GitCoin DAO.

We've seen the power of free revolutionize many aspects of our lives, and as a public good, we can change what people expect from digital marketplaces. We believe this will help entice new users and builders to join the Web3 movement.

Web3 has already revolutionized finance with decentralized finance (Defi). We believe Free-Over-Time markets are the next logical step in decentralizing digital markets.
